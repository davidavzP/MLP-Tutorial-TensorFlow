# MLP-Tutorial-TensorFlow

This repository contains an approachable tutorial on how to build Multi-Layer Perceptrons with TensorFlow.

The tutorial teaches an undergraduate-level student how to use TensorFlow to build a Multi-Layer Perceptron while becoming familiar with the Neural Network jargon. After reading this paper, exploring the TensorFlow documentation should feel very familiar. The tutorial provides fully explained code samples and helpful visuals of network structures. It also includes a complete breakdown explanation of Gradient Descent (including many examples) and demonstrates how to implement it in TensorFlow. Included is the code for evaluating the model with K-Fold Cross-Validation, contained in the file tutorial_code.py.

Here is a link to a section of the tutorial that shows an example of gradient descent and how to implement it in TensorFlow.
