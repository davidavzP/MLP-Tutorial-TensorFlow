# MLP-Tutorial-TensorFlow


This repository contains an approachable tutorial on how to build Multi-Layer Perceptrons with TensorFlow.
	
The tutorial teaches an undergraduate-level student how to use TensorFlow to build a Multi-Layer Perceptron while becoming familiar with the Neural Network jargon. After reading and walking through the code, reading and exploring the TensorFlow documentation should feel very familiar. The tutorial provides code samples fully explained and helps visuals of the network structure. It also includes a full breakdown explanation of Gradient Descent (including many examples) and explains how to implement it in TensorFlow. Included is the code for evaluating the model with K-Fold Cross-Validation, contained in the file tutorial_code.py.
