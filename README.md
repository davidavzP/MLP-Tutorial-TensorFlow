# MLP-Tutorial-TensorFlow


This repository contains an approachable tutorial on how to build Multi-Layer Perceptrons with TensorFlow.
The tutorial teaches an undergraduate-level student how to use TensorFlow to build Neural Networks while 
becoming familiar with the MLP jargon. After reading and walking through the code, reading and exploring 
the TensorFlow documentation should feel very familiar.  Included is the code for evaluating the model with K-Fold Cross-Validation.
